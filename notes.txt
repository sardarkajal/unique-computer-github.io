CSS defines three types of gradients:

Linear Gradients (goes down/up/left/right/diagonally)
Radial Gradients (defined by their center)
Conic Gradients (rotated around a center point)

Linear Gradients (goes down/up/left/right/diagonally)
a)background-image: linear-gradient(direction, color-stop1, color-stop2, ...);


CSS Radial Gradients
A radial gradient is defined by its center.

To create a radial gradient you must also define at least two color stops.

Syntax
b)background-image: radial-gradient(shape size at position, start-color, ..., last-color);

Radial Gradient - Evenly Spaced Color Stops (this is default)


CSS Conic Gradients
A conic gradient is a gradient with color transitions rotated around a center point.

To create a conic gradient you must define at least two colors.

Syntax
background-image: conic-gradient([from angle] [at position,] color [degree], color [degree], ...);
